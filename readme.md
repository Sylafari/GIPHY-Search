Project 2 : GIPHY API Call with JSON/AJAX
Functionality Offered: A search query that returns GIFs related to the search queries in a Flexbox.
Technologies Used: .html, .css, .js, Bootstrap, JQuery
Ideas for Future Improvement:
1. Resize the images aspect ratio dynamically on the page  
2. A more engaging design such as possibly making the pictures fade in on search
3. Adding more functionality for the desktop versus when scaling down to mobile

Requirements still needed: 
1. Multiple links in Menu
2. Flex for the site name and nav bar
3. Flex to ensure input field and submit button are side by side
4. Mobile and Desktop @media queries
